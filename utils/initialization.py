Weight initialization methods overview and selection rule of thumb:

Xavier (Glorot) Initialization:
    - Pros: Works well for layers with Sigmoid or Tanh activation functions; balances variance of input and output.
    - Cons: Not suitable for ReLU activations.
    - When to use: Deep networks with Sigmoid, Tanh, or Softmax activations.

He Initialization:
    - Pros: Works well for layers with ReLU activations; prevents vanishing gradients.
    - Cons: Not suitable for Sigmoid or Tanh activations.
    - When to use: Deep networks with ReLU or leaky ReLU activations.

LeCun Initialization:
    - Pros: Works well for layers with SELU activations; maintains self-normalizing property.
    - Cons: Not suitable for other activation functions.
    - When to use: Deep networks with SELU activations.

Zero Initialization:
    - Pros: Simple and easy to implement.
    - Cons: Can cause vanishing or exploding gradients; not suitable for deep networks.
    - When to use: For b initialization; not recommended for a initialization.

One Initialization:
    - Pros: Simple and easy to implement.
    - Cons: Can cause vanishing or exploding gradients; not suitable for deep networks.
    - When to use: Rarely used; not recommended for most cases.

Uniform Initialization:
    - Pros: Works well when the initialization range is set appropriately.
    - Cons: Can cause vanishing or exploding gradients if the range is not set properly.
    - When to use: For shallow networks or as a baseline initialization method.

Normal Initialization:
    - Pros: Works well when the mean and standard deviation are set appropriately.
    - Cons: Can cause vanishing or exploding gradients if the parameters are not set properly.
    - When to use: For shallow networks or as a baseline initialization method; can also be used in deeper networks 
        if the activation functions and architecture allow for it.
    
Truncated Normal Initialization:
    - Pros: Similar to normal initialization but avoids extreme values, reducing the chances of vanishing or exploding 
        gradients.
    - Cons: Can still cause vanishing or exploding gradients if the parameters are not set properly.
    - When to use: As an alternative to normal initialization when you want to limit the range of initialized values.

Orthogonal Initialization:
    - Pros: Preserves the norm of the input, which can help with gradient flow and convergence.
    - Cons: Only applicable to square matrices or layers with an equal number of input and output units.
    - When to use: For recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or when the input and output dimensions are equal.

Identity Initialization:
    - Pros: Preserves the identity of the input, which can help with gradient flow and convergence.
    - Cons: Only applicable to square matrices or layers with an equal number of input and output units.
    - When to use: For RNNs or when the input and output dimensions are equal, and you want the layer to initially 
        behave like an identity mapping.
